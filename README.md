# Ansh & Riley Full-Stack Template

This is a full-stack template project for Software Composers to create  applications with AI.

## Getting started
To create a new project, you go to `/paths`, choose from our list of Paths, and then use Cursor's Composer feature to quickly scaffold your project!

You can also edit the Path's prompt template to be whatever you like!

## Technologies used
This doesn't really matter, but is useful for the AI to understand more about this project. We are using the following technologies
- React with Next.js 14 App Router
- TailwindCSS
- Firebase Auth, Storage, and Database
- Multiple AI endpoints including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Replicate using Vercel's AI SDK

# InsightLens AI - Learning Enhanced by AI

InsightLens AI is a powerful learning platform that uses artificial intelligence to help students and learners master content more effectively. The platform offers a range of tools including text summarization, flashcard creation, quiz generation, and more.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Upload documents or paste text to get concise summaries
- **Smart Flashcards**: Generate study-ready flashcards from your notes or readings
- **Quiz Generation**: Test your knowledge with AI-generated quizzes
- **Chrome Extension**: Use InsightLens AI while browsing the web
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication system
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Subscription management for premium features

## Stripe Payment Integration

The application includes a complete Stripe payment flow for handling subscriptions:

1. **Free Trial**: Users can start a 3-day free trial of the Pro plan
2. **Subscription Management**: Users can view and manage their subscription in the dashboard
3. **Webhook Handling**: The application processes Stripe webhooks to keep subscription status up to date

### Payment Flow

1. User selects the Pro plan on the pricing page
2. User enters their payment information in the StripeCheckout component
3. The application creates a subscription with a trial period
4. After the trial ends, the user is charged the monthly subscription fee
5. Users can cancel their subscription at any time from the settings page

### Technical Implementation

- `src/app/components/StripeCheckout.tsx`: The checkout form component
- `src/app/components/PricingSection.tsx`: The pricing section with plan options
- `src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts`: API route for creating subscriptions
- `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`: API route for handling Stripe webhooks
- `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`: Settings page with subscription management

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_firebase_messaging_sender_id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Next Steps

To fully implement Stripe in production:

1. Create a Stripe account and get API keys
2. Replace the simulated Stripe implementation with actual Stripe API calls
3. Set up a proper webhook endpoint with signature verification
4. Use Stripe Customer Portal for subscription management
5. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Notes for Developers

- The current implementation simulates Stripe functionality for development purposes
- In production, you should use the official Stripe library and follow security best practices
- Make sure to test the subscription flow thoroughly before going live
- Consider adding payment confirmation emails and notifications
